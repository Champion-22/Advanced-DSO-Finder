# Advanced DSO Finder ðŸ”­

An interactive web tool for amateur astronomers to plan Deep Sky observations.

This application, built with Streamlit, helps find Deep Sky Objects (DSOs) observable from a specific location at a chosen time, considering various astronomical conditions and user preferences. It utilizes an external catalog file (e.g., from OpenNGC) for its object data and provides graphical representations of object visibility.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **External Catalog:** Uses data loaded from a local CSV file (e.g., `ongc.csv` from OpenNGC) containing object information (Name, Type, RA, Dec, Magnitude).
* **Location Input:**
    * **Search by Name:** Enter a location name (city, observatory, etc.) to automatically fetch coordinates using geocoding (requires internet).
    * **Manual Entry:** Input precise longitude, latitude, and altitude.
* **Time Selection:**
    * Plan for the upcoming night (based on current time).
    * Select any specific date in the past or future.
* **Automatic Timezone:** Detects and uses the appropriate local timezone based on the provided coordinates (requires `timezonefinder`). Displays the detected timezone.
* **Brightness Filter:**
    * **Bortle Scale:** Filter based on estimated limiting magnitude for Bortle scale values (1-9).
    * **Manual Range:** Define a specific minimum and maximum magnitude.
* **Minimum Altitude:** Set the minimum required altitude (degrees above the horizon) for an object to be considered observable.
* **Object Type Filter:** Select specific DSO types (e.g., Galaxy, Nebula, Cluster) via a multi-select dropdown. An object type glossary is provided for clarity.
* **Peak Direction Filter:** Optionally filter results to show only objects reaching their maximum altitude in a specific cardinal direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) or select "All".
* **Moon Phase Display & Warning:** Shows the current moon illumination percentage and provides a visual warning if it exceeds a user-defined threshold.
* **Result Sorting & Limiting:**
    * Limit the maximum number of results displayed.
    * Sort results by:
        * **Visibility Duration & Altitude:** Prioritizes objects visible for the longest continuous duration within the observation window, then by highest peak altitude.
        * **Brightness:** Lists the brightest objects first.
* **Detailed Results:** Each result shows:
    * Name, Type, Magnitude.
    * Full Constellation Name (determined via Astropy).
    * RA/Dec coordinates.
    * Maximum Altitude reached during the observation window, along with Azimuth and Cardinal Direction at that time.
    * Best observation time (time of maximum altitude) in the detected local timezone.
    * Maximum *continuous* duration (in hours) the object is above the minimum altitude during the observation window.
* **Interactive Graphs:**
    * **Graph Type Selector:** Choose between two graph types globally for all displayed graphs.
    * **Sky Path Graph (Az/Alt):** Displays the object's path across the sky (Azimuth vs. Altitude) during the observation window. Points are colored by Azimuth, and hourly time markers are shown.
    * **Altitude/Time Graph:** Displays the object's altitude over time during the observation window.
    * Graphs are available for each object in the results list and for custom targets.
* **Custom Target Graph:** Input custom RA/Dec coordinates (and an optional name) to generate a visibility graph for any object, using the current location, time, and filter settings.
* **CSV Export:** Download the filtered and sorted results list (including constellation and visibility duration) as a CSV file (semicolon-separated, UTF-8).
* **Multilingual:** Interface available in English, German, and French.
* **Modern Dark Theme:** Uses a custom dark theme for better viewing comfort.

## ðŸš€ Run App (Locally)

To run the app on your own computer:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME with your details
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```

2.  **Obtain Catalog File:**
    * Download a suitable catalog file (e.g., from the [OpenNGC](https://github.com/mattiaverga/OpenNGC) project). Ensure it's **semicolon-separated (`;`)** and contains columns like `Name`, `Type`, `RA`, `Dec`, and a magnitude column (e.g., `V-Mag`, `B-Mag`, or `Mag`).
    * Place the downloaded CSV file (e.g., `ongc.csv`) **in the main directory** of the cloned repository, alongside the Python script.
    * **Verify/Adjust Code:** Make sure the `CATALOG_FILENAME` variable in the Python script matches the name of your downloaded file. Check the `load_ongc_data` function if needed to ensure the magnitude column name detection (`mag_cols`) matches your file.

3.  **Create & Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create (only needed once)
    python -m venv .venv

    # Activate (Windows PowerShell)
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

    # Activate (MacOS/Linux Bash)
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *Note: Use the activation command appropriate for your operating system and shell.*

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Ensure `requirements.txt` includes: `streamlit`, `astropy`, `astroplan`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `pytz`, `geopy`, `timezonefinder`)*

5.  **Start Streamlit App:**
    ```bash
    # Replace Advanced_DSO_Finder_XYZ.py with the actual name of your Python script if different
    streamlit run Advanced_DSO_Finder_XYZ.py
    ```

The app should now open in your web browser.
