# Advanced DSO Finder üî≠

An interactive web tool for amateur astronomers to plan Deep Sky observations, originally inspired by the Vespera Pro telescope but generally useful.

This application, built with Streamlit, helps find Deep Sky Objects (DSOs) observable from a specific location at a chosen time, considering sky quality and other factors.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Location Selection:** Default location (Sch√∂tz, Switzerland) or manual input of longitude, latitude, and altitude.
* **Time Selection:** Plan for the upcoming night (based on current time) or select any date.
* **Brightness Filter:**
    * Automatically based on the Bortle scale (1-9).
    * Or manual input of a magnitude range (Min/Max).
* **Minimum Altitude:** Adjustable minimum height above the horizon that objects must reach.
* **Object Type Filter:** Selection of specific DSO types (e.g., Galaxy, Nebula, Star Cluster).
* **Moon Phase Display & Warning:** Shows the current moon illumination and warns (in red) if an adjustable threshold is exceeded.
* **Result Options:**
    * Adjustable number of objects to display.
    * Optional sorting by brightness (brightest first) instead of random selection.
* **Detail View:** Expandable detailed information for each object (coordinates, max altitude, best observation time).
* **Altitude Plot:** Option to display an altitude graph over the night for each result object (requires Matplotlib).
* **CSV Export:** Download the results list as a CSV file.
